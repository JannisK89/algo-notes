# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object
called a node. Each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node
in the sequence.

## Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Access    | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(n)       |
| Insertion | O(1)       |
| Deletion  | O(1)       |

## Example

```typescript
